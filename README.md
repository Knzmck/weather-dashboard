# Weather-Dashboard

## About

The goal of this project is to create a site that can check the current weather and 5-day forecasts for any city. 

## Assets

Assets include a style.css page, bootstrap features, JQUERY and moment.js.
https://openweathermap.org/ used to get weather information. 

## Features

-Application can search for current temperature (in F), humidity, wind speed, UV index, as well as the 5-day forecast of weather conditions, temperature in F and humidity. 
-Current UV index will be green if good, orange if moderate, orangered if high, red if very high, and violet if dangerously high.
-Defaults to Kansas City weather upon loading if no previous searches in local storage or first time on website.
-Saves previous 8 cities in local storage and generates corresponding buttons upon loading or refreshing page. 
-Does not allow search for invalid city names or duplicate city names.
-Generates buttons with proper capitalization (not minding the way the user initially types it in)
