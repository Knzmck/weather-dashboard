-Current UV index will be green if good, orange if moderate, orangered if high, red if very high, and violet if dangerously high.
-Defaults to Kansas City weather upon loading if no previous searches in local storage or first time on website.
-Saves previous 8 cities in local storage and generates corresponding buttons upon loading or refreshing page.
